Database
========

For storing information about the workflows, machine learning, 
DFT simlations and other structure manipulations, MongoDB 
is used as a permament, shared database.
MongoDB is a NoSQL database, with bson dictionaries as documents,
which is very close to python documents. If you know python,
MongoDB documents are easy to read and query.
