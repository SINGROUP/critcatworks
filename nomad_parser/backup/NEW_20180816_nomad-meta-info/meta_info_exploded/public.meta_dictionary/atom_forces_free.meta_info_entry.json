    "Forces acting on the atoms, calculated as minus gradient of energy_free, ",
    "**including** constraints, if present. The derivatives with respect to ",
    "displacements of the nuclei are evaluated in Cartesian coordinates. The ",
    "(electronic) energy_free contains the information on the change in (fractional) ",
    "occupation of the electronic eigenstates, which are accounted for in the ",
    "derivatives, yielding a truly energy-conserved quantity. In addition, these ",
    "forces are obtained by filtering out the unitary transformations ",
    "(center-of-mass translations and rigid rotations for non-periodic systems, see ",
    "atom_forces_free_raw for the unfiltered counterpart). Forces due to constraints ",
    "such as fixed atoms, distances, angles, dihedrals, etc. are included (see ",
