Worklow manager for DFT simulations on nanocluster databases using Fireworks

Work in progress, the first version will feature a workflow to 
  -automatically generate adsorbates on nanoclusters
  -rank the cluster-adsorbate structures based on similarity
  -run CP2K calculations
  -do machine learning on the fly

Dependencies:
fireworks
